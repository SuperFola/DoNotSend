# Changelog

## Unreleased changes
### Added
- converter.py, to encode/decode ascii in base 32 and base 64 flawlessly
- packet.py to encapsulate a lot of dull work
- threaded udp socket server binded on port 53 otherwise we have an ICMP type 3 error (port unreachable, because nothing is binded to it)

- the replies come in DNS reply answer field, as TXT
- the request is now a TXT request
- the answer now includes the original question
- the IP packet is constructed with a TOS of 0x28 (normal priority, high throughput)
- TTL was added to the answer
- transaction id added to DNS layer (random, generated by client)
- random source port for UDP packet
